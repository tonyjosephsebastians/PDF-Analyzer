###  Word Document Analyzer with Streamlit

---

#### Overview

The **Word Document Analyzer** is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a DOCX file, extract its content, and ask questions about the document using advanced AI models. The application integrates LangChain for text processing and Google Generative AI models for answering user queries. It is a simple and efficient tool for analyzing the contents of documents and retrieving relevant information.

### System Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that the following system requirements are met:

- **Python 3.7+**: Python version 3.7 or above should be installed on your machine.
- **Libraries**: Ensure the required libraries are installed. These are listed in the dependencies section.

---

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Project Files**

   Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project folder in the terminal (or Command Prompt) and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don’t have the `requirements.txt` file, manually install the required libraries using:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit python-docx langchain faiss-cpu langchain-google-genai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set Up Google API Key**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add your Google API key to the `.env` file in the following format:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

   If you do not have a Google API key, please visit [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) to create a project and generate an API key.

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Open the Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project/directory
   ```

2. **Run the Batch File**

   The easiest way to launch the Streamlit app is by running the `run.bat` file. Double-click the `run.bat` file or run the following command in the Command Prompt:

   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```

   This will set up the necessary environment variables and launch the Streamlit server.

3. **Open the Application**

### Using the Application

Once the application is running, follow these steps to use the Word Document Analyzer:

#### 1. **Enter Your Google API Key**

   - In the **sidebar**, enter your **Google API Key** in the provided input box. The API key is required to interact with the Google Generative AI models.
   - Select the desired **model** from the dropdown. You can choose between:
     - `gemini-2.0-flash`
     - `gemini-1.0-pro`

   The app will alert you if the API key is missing or invalid.

#### 2. **Upload a DOCX File**

   - Use the **file uploader** to upload a DOCX file. The document text will be extracted automatically, and the preview will be displayed.
   - If the document does not contain any readable text, an error message will appear, indicating that no text was found.

#### 3. **Preview the Extracted Text**

   - Once the document is successfully loaded, the extracted text will be shown as a preview in a text area (only the first 1000 characters for brevity).
   - You can scroll to review the content of the document.

#### 4. **Ask Questions About the Document**

   - After uploading the document, you can **ask a question** about its contents.
   - The app will use the **selected Google model** to retrieve relevant sections of the document and generate an answer based on those sections.

   If the question does not have relevant content, the app will notify you with a warning message.

#### 5. **View the Answer**

   - If a relevant answer is found, the application will display the response generated by the selected AI model.
   - The answer is displayed in a **success box**, showing the result of the query.

---

### Error Handling

In case of errors, such as issues with file processing or missing API keys, the app will display appropriate error messages to guide the user. The possible error scenarios are:

- **No Text Found**: If the uploaded DOCX file does not contain any extractable text, a message will notify the user.
- **Invalid API Key**: If the API key is not entered or is invalid, the application will display a warning and stop further execution.
- **Processing Errors**: If there is an error during file processing or question answering, the application will display an error message with details.

---

### Customization (Advanced)

For advanced users, you can modify the following parameters to customize the application:

- **Text Chunking Settings**: Adjust the chunk size and overlap in the `CharacterTextSplitter` to control how the document is split into smaller text chunks.
- **Embedding Model**: You can change the model used for embeddings by modifying the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` model name to any supported model from Hugging Face.
- **Generative AI Models**: To change the AI model, update the list of available models in the model selection dropdown.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Problem: Application not loading in browser.**
  - Ensure that Streamlit is installed properly and that there are no issues with your local server. You can also check for any firewall or proxy settings blocking the server.
  - Verify the batch file (`run.bat`) executes without errors.

- **Problem: No response to question input.**
  - Ensure that the uploaded DOCX file contains valid text and that the correct API key is entered. The app uses Google Generative AI for answering questions, so an invalid key may prevent it from working.
  
- **Problem: Error processing DOCX file.**
  - Check the format of the DOCX file to ensure it is not corrupted. Try opening the file manually to verify its contents.
